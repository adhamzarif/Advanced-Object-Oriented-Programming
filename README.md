   - Operations such as reading from and writing to files, handling directories, and file management are discussed.
   - File I/O best practices and error handling.

### 2. **Collections in Java**
   - A detailed exploration of the Java Collections Framework.
   - Understand the different types of collections: Lists, Sets, Maps, and Queues.
   - Best practices for choosing the right collection for different use cases.
   - Iteration, sorting, and manipulation of collections.

### 3. **JavaFX Basics**
   - Introduction to JavaFX for creating desktop applications.
   - Creating simple GUIs using `Stage`, `Scene`, and `Pane`.
   - Handling user input, buttons, text fields, and layout management.
   - Binding, event handling, and basic animation.

### 4. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Basics**
   - Fundamental concepts of OOP such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
   - How to design and structure your classes to adhere to OOP principles.
   - Example-based learning with hands-on exercises.

### 5. **SceneBuilder**
   - Introduction to SceneBuilder, a graphical tool to design JavaFX user interfaces.
